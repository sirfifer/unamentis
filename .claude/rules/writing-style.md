# Writing Style Rules

These rules apply to all documentation, comments, and text written in this project.

## Punctuation

**Never use em dashes or en dashes as sentence interrupters.** This is a strict rule.

- Wrong: "The feature — which was added last week — improves performance"
- Wrong: "The feature – which was added last week – improves performance"
- Correct: "The feature, which was added last week, improves performance"
- Also correct: "The feature improves performance. It was added last week."

Use commas for parenthetical phrases. Use periods to break up long sentences. Do not use dashes as a substitute for commas or to set off phrases.

## General Style

- Be concise and direct
- Use active voice
- Avoid jargon unless it's standard in the domain
- Match the existing tone and style of the codebase
