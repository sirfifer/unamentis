# UnaMentis Trademark Policy

## Overview

This document describes the policy for use of the UnaMentis trademarks. While the UnaMentis source code is available under the MIT License, the UnaMentis name, logos, and other brand features are protected trademarks and are NOT covered by that license.

## Trademark Ownership

"UnaMentis," the UnaMentis logo (profile silhouette with wordmark), and the UnaMentis "UM" icon are trademarks of Richard Amerman. These marks identify the official UnaMentis project and distinguish it from unofficial derivatives.

## Our Commitment to Open Source

We believe in open source and want the community to be able to use, modify, and build upon UnaMentis. This trademark policy aims to balance:

1. **Community freedom** to use, modify, and distribute the software
