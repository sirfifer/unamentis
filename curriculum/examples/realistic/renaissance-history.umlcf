People believed the world was in decline from the glorious days of ancient Rome. Then the Black Death shattered this world, killing perhaps a third of Europe's population but also shaking up the old social order and causing people to question old assumptions. Trade was growing, cities were expanding, and a new merchant class was rising. All of these changes set the stage for something new, something we call the Renaissance.",

He collected ancient manuscripts and paid scholars to translate them from Greek into Latin. He founded the Platonic Academy, where intellectuals gathered to discuss philosophy. When Cosimo died, the grateful citizens of Florence gave him the title 'Father of his Country.'",
