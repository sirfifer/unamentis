People believed the world was in decline from the glorious days of ancient Rome. Then the Black Death shattered this world, killing perhaps a third of Europe's population but also shaking up the old social order and causing people to question old assumptions. Trade was growing, cities were expanding, and a new merchant class was rising. All of these changes set the stage for something new, something we call the Renaissance.",

Second, political structure: Italy's independent city-states competed with each other, and this competition extended to art and culture. Third, patronage: wealthy families like the Medici supported artists, allowing them to focus on their work. Fourth, the classical past: Roman ruins surrounded Italians, and Greek scholars brought ancient texts when Constantinople fell. Fifth, humanism: a new philosophy celebrated human achievement and potential. All of these factors combined to create the perfect conditions for an artistic and intellectual explosion. That explosion was the Renaissance, and it would transform not just Italy, but eventually all of Europe and the world.",

The bank's symbol, six balls on a shield, became one of the most recognized symbols in Europe. Some say the balls represent coins; others say they represent pills, since the family name might come from 'medico,' meaning doctor."

The opening was too wide for traditional methods. Filippo Brunelleschi, a goldsmith and architect, proposed a radical solution: build the dome without scaffolding, using a double shell and a herringbone brick pattern. People thought it was impossible. The dome took 16 years to build and remains the largest masonry dome ever constructed. To this day, engineers study it to understand how Brunelleschi did it."

Suddenly, Italian humanists could read Plato's dialogues in the original Greek. This influx of classical knowledge helped fuel the Renaissance. From disaster came intellectual revival."
