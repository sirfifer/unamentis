# About UnaMentis

## AI-Powered Learning That Makes You Smarter, Not Dependent

We live in an age where AI can write essays, solve problems, and answer any question instantly. This power is extraordinary, but it's also dangerous without foundation. A calculator is useless to someone who doesn't understand what multiplication means. AI writing is hollow to someone who has never formed their own thoughts.

UnaMentis takes a different approach: **AI as tutor, not substitute.**

We use artificial intelligence to deliver personalized, voice-based instruction at scale. But our goal isn't to give you answers. It's to build genuine understanding. We challenge you to explain concepts back in your own words. We celebrate the time you spend thinking before asking for help. We revisit what you learned last week to make sure you truly remember it.

AI is at the core of what we're building, but the real core is you: your knowledge, your understanding, your growth. Quality curriculum, often from institutions like MIT, combined with AI that guides rather than replaces, creates something powerful: a tutor that makes you genuinely smarter over time.

**This is education technology that serves learning, not shortcuts.**

## Core Values

### 1. Genuine Understanding Over Speed

Many educational tools optimize for getting through material quickly. UnaMentis optimizes for actually learning it. Our 60-90+ minute voice sessions aren't about efficiency. They're about creating space for the kind of deep engagement that produces lasting understanding.

### 2. Productive Struggle Is Learning

When you spend time thinking through a problem before asking for help, that's not wasted time. That's learning happening. We track and celebrate productive struggle because cognitive effort is where memory forms. If it feels too easy, you're probably not learning.

### 3. Verification, Not Trust

Immediate comprehension isn't the same as lasting knowledge. We revisit concepts across sessions, asking you to recall what you learned previously. This spaced retrieval doesn't just test memory; it strengthens it. Real learning is proven over time, not in the moment.

### 4. Quality Curriculum Matters

Whether content comes from MIT OpenCourseWare, CK-12, or is AI-enriched, we hold it to the same standard: Does it build genuine understanding? Is it designed for voice-based delivery? Does it challenge learners to think, not just listen?

### 5. The Learner Is the Center

AI powers our system, but you are the product. Not in the sense of data extraction, but in the sense of outcome. The measure of UnaMentis's success is how much smarter, more capable, and more knowledgeable you become through using it.

## What UnaMentis Is

- **A voice-first AI tutor** for extended learning sessions (60-90+ minutes)
- **Curriculum-driven** with content from respected sources (MIT, CK-12, and more)
- **Understanding-focused** with teachback protocols, productive struggle metrics, and spaced retrieval
- **Privacy-respecting** with on-device capabilities and user control
- **Open source at its core** for transparency and community contribution

## What UnaMentis Is Not

- **A homework answering machine**: We don't give you answers. We help you find them.
- **A replacement for thinking**: AI guides, but you do the cognitive work.
- **A speed-optimization tool**: Fast completion means nothing if you didn't learn.
- **A data extraction product**: Your learning is for your benefit, not ours.

## Development Philosophy

UnaMentis is developed with 100% AI assistance. We use Claude, GitHub Copilot, and other AI tools throughout development. This isn't hypocritical. It's precisely because we understand AI's power that we're building a tool to ensure that power enhances human capability rather than replacing it.

The developers using AI to build UnaMentis have foundational software engineering knowledge. The AI accelerates our work; it doesn't do our thinking for us. This is the same relationship we want students to have with AI: a powerful tool wielded by a capable human.

## Open Source Commitment

The fundamental core of UnaMentis will always remain open source:

- Core voice pipeline and session management
- Curriculum system (UMCF specification) and progress tracking
- All provider integrations (STT, TTS, LLM, VAD)
- Cross-platform expansion as it develops

This ensures the greatest possible audience can collaborate on and benefit from this work. Enterprise features may be offered commercially, but they build on top of the open core without restricting it.

## The Founding Insight

> "Even while AI is at the core of what we're doing in many ways, the core we actually want to emphasize, the real core of our tool and system, is the individual user and quality curriculum. It's all about the content and how the user engages with that content. To engage the student and reinforce their genuine understanding. To challenge them with questions. To ask them to rephrase their understanding in their own words. To demonstrate a level of understanding that has some depth and true comprehension to it."
