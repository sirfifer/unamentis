## Current State Assessment

### Existing Assets to Protect

| Asset | Type | Files |
|-------|------|-------|
| **"UnaMentis" wordmark** | Standard character mark | N/A (text only) |
| **Expanded logo** | Design mark (composite) | `images/UnaMentis_expanded_color.png` |
| **Compact logo ("UM")** | Design mark | `images/UnaMentis_compact_color.png` |
| **App icon** | Design mark | `UnaMentis/Assets.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset/` |

### Current IP Status

- **Copyright**: MIT License, Copyright (c) 2025 Richard Amerman
- **Trademark**: Unregistered (common law rights may exist through use)
- **Domain**: (verify ownership of unamentis.com and variants)

### Key Considerations

1. **Open Source Context**: MIT License covers code, but NOT the trademark/branding
2. **Commercial Intent**: Planning to form a company based on UnaMentis
3. **Distinctiveness**: "UnaMentis" (Latin: "One Mind") is likely distinctive/suggestive, which is favorable for registration

### Priority Order

1. **Highest Priority**: Standard character mark "UnaMentis" (most versatile protection)
2. **High Priority**: Expanded logo design mark
3. **Medium Priority**: Compact "UM" logo design mark

---

## Phase 1: Pre-Filing Preparation

### Step 1.1: Comprehensive Trademark Search (Week 1-2)

Before filing, conduct thorough searches to identify potential conflicts.

#### Free Preliminary Searches

1. **USPTO TESS Database**
   - URL: https://tess2.uspto.gov/
   - Search for: "UnaMentis", "Una Mentis", "UNAMENTIS"
   - Search phonetic equivalents and similar marks

2. **State Trademark Databases**
   - Each state maintains separate trademark registrations
   - Focus on states where you'll do business (incorporation state, CA, NY, TX)

3. **Domain Name Search**
   - Check availability of: unamentis.com, unamentis.io, unamentis.app
   - Check social media handles: @unamentis on Twitter/X, Instagram, GitHub

4. **Common Law Search**
   - Google search for "UnaMentis" in quotes
   - Search app stores (Apple App Store, Google Play)
   - Search business registries

#### Professional Search (Recommended)

| Service | Cost | Turnaround |
|---------|------|------------|
| USPTO Certified Search | $150-300 | 1-2 weeks |
| Comprehensive Professional Search (Thomson Reuters, Corsearch) | $500-1,500 | 1-2 weeks |
| Attorney-Conducted Search + Opinion | $1,000-3,000 | 2-4 weeks |

**Recommendation**: At minimum, use USPTO's free TESS search. For commercial launch, invest in a professional comprehensive search ($500-1,500) to avoid costly conflicts later.

### Step 1.2: Identify Goods/Services Classes (Week 1)

USPTO uses the Nice Classification system. For UnaMentis, relevant classes include:

#### Primary Classes (Must File)

| Class | Description | Specific Goods/Services |
|-------|-------------|------------------------|
| **Class 9** | Computer software | "Downloadable mobile application software for educational purposes, namely, voice-based AI tutoring" |
| **Class 42** | SaaS/Technology Services | "Providing temporary use of non-downloadable software for voice-based AI tutoring; Software as a service (SaaS) featuring software for educational purposes" |

#### Secondary Classes (Consider)

| Class | Description | Specific Goods/Services |
|-------|-------------|------------------------|
| **Class 41** | Education Services | "Educational services, namely, providing AI-powered tutoring services in the field of [subjects]" |
| **Class 38** | Telecommunications | "Providing online voice communication services for educational purposes" |

**Cost Impact**: Each additional class adds ~$250-350 to filing fees.

### Step 1.3: Establish Date of First Use (Week 1)

Document your earliest use of the UnaMentis mark in commerce:

1. **First Use Anywhere**: Date you first used the mark (even internally)
2. **First Use in Commerce**: Date you first used the mark in interstate/international commerce

**Evidence to Preserve**:
- Screenshots of app with dates
- Git commit history showing first use of branding
- Website archives (Wayback Machine)
- Marketing materials, social media posts
- Beta tester communications
- App Store submission dates

### Step 1.4: Prepare Specimens (Week 2)

USPTO requires specimens showing the mark as actually used in commerce.

#### For Software (Class 9)
- Screenshot of app showing the mark
- Screenshot of app store listing
- Screenshot of download page

#### For Services (Class 42)
- Screenshot of website offering the service
- Screenshot of app login/splash screen
- Marketing materials showing the service

**Requirements**:
- Must show mark as customers encounter it
- Must be in actual use (not mockups)
- Digital files: JPG or PNG, max 5MB, 944x944 min, 3000x3000 max

---

## Phase 2: USPTO Federal Registration

### Step 2.1: Choose Application Basis

| Basis | When to Use | Requirements |
|-------|-------------|--------------|
| **Section 1(a) - Use in Commerce** | Already selling/offering the service | Specimens of actual use required |
| **Section 1(b) - Intent to Use** | Planning to launch but not yet in commerce | Must file Statement of Use before registration |

**Recommendation**: If the app is live in the App Store, use Section 1(a). If pre-launch, use Section 1(b).

### Step 2.2: File USPTO Application (Week 3-4)

#### Filing Options

| Method | Cost per Class | Pros | Cons |
|--------|---------------|------|------|
| **TEAS Plus** | $250/class | Lowest cost | Must use USPTO's pre-approved descriptions |
| **TEAS Standard** | $350/class | Custom descriptions | Higher cost |

**Recommendation**: Start with TEAS Plus if your goods/services fit pre-approved descriptions.

#### Filing Process

1. **Create USPTO.gov Account**
   - URL: https://www.uspto.gov/trademarks
   - Create account at https://my.uspto.gov/

2. **Prepare Application Information**
   ```
   Mark Type: Standard Character Mark (for wordmark)
              Design Mark (for logos)

   Owner: Richard Amerman (individual)
          OR
          [Company Name] LLC/Inc. (after formation)

   Address: [Legal address for correspondence]

   Basis: 1(a) Use in Commerce OR 1(b) Intent to Use

   Goods/Services: [From Step 1.2]

   First Use Date: [From Step 1.3]

   Specimens: [From Step 1.4]
   ```

3. **File Applications**
   - File standard character mark first
   - File design marks separately (or together if budget allows)

4. **Pay Fees**
   - TEAS Plus: $250 per class per mark
   - Example: 2 classes × 3 marks = $1,500 minimum

### Step 2.3: USPTO Examination Process (Months 3-12)

```
Timeline:
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Month 0   │ Application Filed                                    │
│ Month 3-6 │ Assigned to Examining Attorney                       │
│ Month 4-8 │ Office Action (if issues found) - 6 months to respond│
│ Month 6-10│ Publication in Official Gazette (30-day opposition)  │
│ Month 8-12│ Registration Certificate Issued                      │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

#### Common Office Actions & Responses

| Issue | Response Strategy |
|-------|-------------------|
| **Likelihood of Confusion** | Argue differences in marks, goods/services, trade channels |
| **Merely Descriptive** | Argue suggestiveness, submit evidence of acquired distinctiveness |
| **Specimen Issues** | Submit corrected specimens showing actual use |
| **Description Too Broad** | Narrow goods/services description |

**Pro Tip**: Consider hiring a trademark attorney for Office Action responses ($500-2,000).

### Step 2.4: Post-Registration Requirements

| Deadline | Requirement | Fee |
|----------|-------------|-----|
| **Years 5-6** | Section 8 Declaration of Use | $225/class |
| **Years 5-6** | Section 15 Declaration of Incontestability (optional but recommended) | $200/class |
| **Years 9-10** | Section 8 Declaration + Section 9 Renewal | $525/class |
| **Every 10 years** | Section 8 + Section 9 | $525/class |

---

## Phase 3: International Protection

### Option A: Madrid Protocol (Recommended)

The Madrid Protocol allows you to extend your US registration to 130+ countries through a single application.

#### Process

1. **Wait for USPTO Application/Registration**
   - Can file based on pending application or registration

2. **File Through USPTO**
   - USPTO acts as "Office of Origin"
   - Single application, single fee structure

3. **Designate Countries**
   - Select countries where you want protection
   - Each country examines independently

#### Cost Structure

| Component | Cost |
|-----------|------|
| Basic Fee | CHF 653 (~$730 USD) |
| Supplementary Fee (per class) | CHF 100 (~$112 USD) |
| Individual Country Fees | Varies by country |

**Example Budget for Key Markets**:
| Country | Individual Fee (CHF) |
|---------|---------------------|
| European Union (all 27 countries) | 914 |
| United Kingdom | 243 |
| China | 249 |
| Japan | 0 (uses supplementary) |
| Australia | 390 |
| Canada | 347 |

**Total for EU + UK + China + Japan + Australia + Canada**: ~CHF 2,896 (~$3,240 USD) + basic fees

### Option B: Direct National Filings

For countries not in Madrid Protocol or for strategic reasons:

| Country | Office | Approximate Cost |
|---------|--------|------------------|
| Canada | CIPO | CAD 458+ |
| India | IP India | INR 9,000+ |
| Brazil | INPI | BRL 415+ |

### Priority Countries for UnaMentis

Based on EdTech market size and English-speaking markets:

| Priority | Countries | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|-----------|
| 1 | United States | Primary market |
| 2 | European Union | Large EdTech market, single filing |
| 3 | United Kingdom | Post-Brexit, separate filing needed |
| 4 | Canada | English-speaking, USMCA alignment |
| 5 | Australia | English-speaking EdTech market |
| 6 | India | Large English-speaking population |

## Phase 4: Open Source Trademark Policy

### Why This Matters

Your MIT License grants broad rights to the code, but does NOT grant rights to your trademarks. You need a clear policy to:

1. Allow legitimate community use
2. Prevent confusion about official vs. unofficial versions
3. Protect brand integrity while fostering open source community

### Create a TRADEMARK.md File

Create a trademark policy document in your repository:

```markdown
# UnaMentis Trademark Policy

## Trademark Ownership

"UnaMentis," the UnaMentis logo, and the UnaMentis "UM" icon are trademarks
of [Company Name / Richard Amerman]. While our software is available under
the MIT License, our trademarks are not.

## Permitted Uses (No Permission Needed)

You MAY use our trademarks to:
- Refer to UnaMentis in articles, tutorials, or documentation
- State that your project is "based on UnaMentis" or "compatible with UnaMentis"
- Use in academic/research contexts with proper attribution

## Restricted Uses (Permission Required)

You MUST obtain written permission to:
- Use "UnaMentis" in your product or service name
- Use our logos in any commercial context
- Create merchandise with our marks
- Imply official endorsement or affiliation

## Prohibited Uses

You may NOT:
- Register "UnaMentis" or confusingly similar marks as trademarks

- Use our marks in ways that suggest official endorsement

## Requesting Permission

Contact: [trademark@unamentis.com]

✅ ALLOWED: "This tutorial uses UnaMentis"
✅ ALLOWED: "MyApp integrates with UnaMentis"
❌ NOT ALLOWED: "UnaMentis Pro" (implies official product)
❌ NOT ALLOWED: "UnaMentis Certified Tutoring"
```

### Update LICENSE File

Consider adding a trademark notice to your LICENSE file:

```
MIT License

Copyright (c) 2025 Richard Amerman

[... existing MIT text ...]

---

Trademark Notice: "UnaMentis," the UnaMentis logo, and related marks are
trademarks of [Company Name]. This license does not grant permission to
use these trademarks. See TRADEMARK.md for our trademark policy.
```

### Models from Other Open Source Projects

- **Mozilla**: https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/foundation/trademarks/policy/
- **Linux Foundation**: https://www.linuxfoundation.org/trademark-usage
- **Apache**: https://www.apache.org/foundation/marks/
- **WordPress**: https://wordpressfoundation.org/trademark-policy/

## Phase 5: Company Formation & IP Assignment

### Timing Considerations

```
Option A: File trademarks personally, assign to company later
├── Pros: Can start immediately, no company formation delay
├── Cons: Assignment fees (~$100/mark), potential complications
└── Best if: Urgency to file, company formation timeline uncertain

Option B: Form company first, file trademarks in company name
├── Pros: Clean ownership, no assignment needed
├── Cons: Delays trademark filing, company formation costs
└── Best if: Company formation imminent (< 2 months)
```

**Recommendation**: If company formation is within 2-3 months, wait and file in company name. Otherwise, file personally and assign later.

### IP Assignment Process

If you file personally first, you'll need to assign to the company:

1. **Execute Assignment Agreement**
   - Written agreement transferring trademark rights
   - Include goodwill associated with the mark
   - Both parties sign

2. **Record with USPTO**
   - File assignment via ETAS (Electronic Trademark Assignment System)
   - URL: https://etas.uspto.gov/
   - Fee: $100 per mark

3. **Update All Records**
   - Update owner information with USPTO
   - Update any international registrations

### Company Structure Considerations

| Structure | Trademark Implications |
|-----------|----------------------|
| **LLC** | Simple assignment, pass-through taxation |
| **C-Corp** | Preferred for VC funding, clean IP ownership |
| **Delaware** | Common for tech companies, established case law |

### Founder IP Assignment

When forming the company, include trademark rights in the standard IP assignment:

```
Sample Assignment Language:

Assignor hereby assigns to Company all right, title, and interest in:
(a) The trademarks listed in Exhibit A, including all registrations and
    applications therefor, and all goodwill associated therewith;
(b) All trade names, service marks, logos, and brand names associated
    with the Business;
(c) [Standard patent/copyright assignment language]
```

## Ongoing Maintenance & Enforcement

### Trademark Watching Service

Subscribe to a watching service to monitor for conflicting applications:

| Service | Cost | Coverage |
|---------|------|----------|
| USPTO Alerts (DIY) | Free | US only |
| TrademarkNow | $200-500/year | Global |
| Corsearch | $500-2,000/year | Comprehensive |

### Enforcement Actions

| Situation | Response | Estimated Cost |
|-----------|----------|----------------|
| Similar app in App Store | Takedown notice to Apple | Free-$500 |
| Infringing domain name | UDRP proceeding | $1,500-5,000 |
| Copycat product | Cease & desist letter | $500-2,000 |
| Serious infringement | Federal litigation | $50,000+ |

### Proper Trademark Usage

Always use your marks properly:

```
✅ Correct Usage:
- "UnaMentis® voice tutoring app" (after registration)
- "UnaMentis™ voice tutoring app" (before registration)
- "Download the UnaMentis app"

❌ Incorrect Usage:
- "Download Unamentis" (wrong capitalization)
- "I love unamentising" (using as verb)
- "My UnaMentis" (using as generic noun)
```

### Style Guide Requirements

Create internal brand guidelines specifying:
- Correct capitalization: "UnaMentis" (not "Unamentis" or "UNAMENTIS")
- Logo clear space and minimum sizes
- Approved color variations
- Trademark symbols (™ before registration, ® after)
